### Other Browsers

You can install **ChatTweak** via the User-Script with a tool like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

For [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) it's recommended you set Security > Content Script API to `UserScripts API Dynamic`, for SnapTweak to be injected reliably.
