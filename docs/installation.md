## ðŸ”¹ Option 1: Installing the Userscript

### 1. Install a Userscript Manager
Depending on your browser, install one of these:

- **Chrome / Edge / Brave** â†’ [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)  
- **Firefox** â†’ [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)  
- **Safari** â†’ [Tampermonkey for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/app/tampermonkey/id1482490089)  

### 2. Install the Userscript
- Open the userscript file: [`ChatTweak.user.js`](https://github.com/appelmoesgg/ChatTweak/releases/latest/download/ChatTweak.user.js)  
- Your userscript manager will detect it and prompt you to **install**.  
- Click install and youâ€™re done!

### 3. Updating the Userscript
- Automatic updates are not yet implemented. Please check GitHub occasionally for new releases. Update logic is currently being developed.

### 4. Permission to Execute Userscripts (Chrome/Edge)
For users of the **Tampermonkey extension (v5.3+)** in a **Chrome-based browser**, you must explicitly allow userscripts to run.  

Either the `Allow User Scripts` toggle or `Developer Mode` must be enabled.

Without this step, Tampermonkey cannot execute userscripts, and ChatTweak will not load.

To enable it, follow [this](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php#Q209) guide.
